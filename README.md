Problem statement:

Create an app that does the following:

Reads data from the attached JSON file
Done with the following code (on line 4 of App.tsx)
(import menuData from './menu-data.json';)
Render a list of all the items
Allow the item to be clicked, and bring you to a new page
On the new page, show the item, and allow editing of:
price
isAvailable
Save the changes using React "setState"
Button to go back to main list page
On every update, log the full menu to the console
Then, write some unit tests for the components you made (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests)

Couple things I want to see:

Add a "router" library to handle the page changes (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-router)
Use some stateless components for data display
Using local state to hold the updated items
Use CSS to make the components look good (nothing crazy, but just somewhat presentable)
Have at least 75% unit test coverage (npm run coverage)


his project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
